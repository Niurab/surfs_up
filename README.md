Further analysis for the remaining months is needed to truly confirm the temperature for these months. Apart from the temperature and precipitation, other factors to consider are humidity and wind level as well as the sources for the ingredients and equipment needed.  Additional data and analysis that might be necessary know hotel availability for tourists in the area, the proximity of restaurants to the intended location and how many competitors exist already.
