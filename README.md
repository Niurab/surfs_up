* The temperature for June and December do not vary much and therefore we can conclude that the weather in Oahu is conducive all year-round for the intended shop. The standard deviation of 3.25 and 3.75 for June and December respectively give a consistent temperature around 70’s thereby confirming the sustainability of the surf and ice cream shop.


## Summary:

Both the temperature and precipitation outcomes show that Oahu is an ideal location year-round for the intended shop. Further analysis for the remaining months is needed to confirm the temperature for these months. Apart from the temperature and precipitation, other factors to consider are humidity and wind level as well as the sources for the ingredients and equipment needed.  Additional data and analysis that might be necessary to know include hotel availability for tourists in the area, the proximity of restaurants to the intended location and how many competitors exist already.
